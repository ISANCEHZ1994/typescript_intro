// TypeScript is a programming language created to address the shortcomings of JavaScript
// Benefits: 
//    **Static Typing
//    **Code Completion
//    **Refactoring
//    **Shorthand Notations

// Statically-Typed Languages: C++, C#, Java
// Dynamically-Typed Languages: JavaScript, Python, Ruby

// BASICALLY: TypeScript is just Javascript WITH Type Checking

// Medium to Large projects: TypeScript - Simple Projects: JavaScript

// TRANSPILATION is when TypeScript translates into JavaScript

// outDir inside of tsconfig.json file: specifices the directory that will contain the JavaScript files

// NOTE: had this file outside of scope had to move into the /src folder otherwise error!
